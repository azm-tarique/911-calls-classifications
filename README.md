# 911-calls-classifications
For this capstone project we will be analyzing some 911 call data from Kaggle.

My Contributions:

1.  Import numpy and pandas 
2.  Create a countplot of 911 calls by Reason
3.  Use seaborn's lmplot() to create a linear fit
4.  Separate plots with each plot representing a Reason for the 911 call
5.  Creating heatmaps with seaborn and our data
6.  Create a clustermap using this DataFrame
